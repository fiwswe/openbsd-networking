#	Will be executed when the IPv6 prefix changes for interface em0.
#	See ipv6PrefixCheck.sh for the base logic of the caller.
#
#	Defined variables:
#		interface	The name of the interface ('em0').
#		newPrefix	The new IPv6 address prefix.
#		lastPrefix	The old IPv6 address prefix.
#
#	Available functions:
#		printDebug
#		printMessage
#		buildIPv6Addr
#		getPublicIPv4Address
#
#	Note: The actual action content is a bit muddled as I have only actively implemented
#	and tested what I needed. Take it with a grain of salt.
#

#	Adjust this to the expected interface name.
#	(Could possibly be automated based on the name of this file? But I could not figure
#	out how to access that name in the context of the included script.)
local MY_IF='em0'


#	Abort if not called from the correct context:
#	Note: This will also abort the calling script!
[ "$interface" != "$MY_IF" -o "$0" != 'prefixChanged' ] && exit 1


#printDebug "Test: ${interface}, [${newPrefix}], [${lastPrefix}]"


#	Figure out the current IPv6 address of the interface:
local curAddr=`ifconfig "$interface"|grep -E "inet6.+${newPrefix}"|grep -vE '( fe80:| fd|temporary|decrecated)'|head -1|awk '{print $2}'`

#	It might be a good idea to check whether we have found an address before proceeding.
#	Something like this might work (untested):
if [ -n "$curAddr" ];then
	#	Do the actions here.
fi


#	Update DDNS:
#	In this case I am using the dynv6.com SSH API with SSH configured to connect using the
#	"dynv6" name without needing a password. Setting this up is left as an excersize for
#	the reader.
local hName='myhost'
local dName='account.dynv6.net'
ssh dynv6 'hosts' "$dName" 'records' 'set' "$hName" 'aaaa' 'addr' "$curAddr"
printMessage "Updated ${hName}.${dName} AAAA to ${curAddr}"

#	Update a second hostname at dynv6.com:
local hName='myotherhost'
ssh dynv6 'hosts' "$dName" 'records' 'set' "$hName" 'aaaa' 'addr' "$curAddr"
printMessage "Updated ${hName}.${dName} AAAA to ${curAddr}"

#	Updating other DDNS services should be fairly easy to do. Most offer either a HTTP 
#	URL based update mechanism or an API of some kind.


#	Log some data about the interface (basically the output of ifconfig):
/root/bin/if_log.sh "$interface"
#	Note: The script if_log.sh is not provided. But it is fairly trivial.


#
#	Here are some more ideas for actions:
#

#if [ -n "$newPrefix" ]; then
#
#	#	Update DDNS:
#	#	============
##	ssh dynv6 'hosts' 'account.dynv6.net' 'records' 'set' 'myhost' 'aaaa' 'addr' "$curAddr"
#
#	#	Update pf(4) table:
#	#	===================
#	#	Updating a table using pfctl(8) is much better than modifying /etc/pf.conf and
#	#	restarting pf(4).
#	
#	#	Update service configurations and restart services where necessary:
#	#	====================================================================
#	#	To make this easier use include files in the service configuration where possible
#	#	to keep the definitions of macros for the IPs.
#	#	E.g. httpd(8) allows included files and macros.
#	#	sed(1) can probably be used to exchange old and new IPs.
#	#	Don't forget to reload the service after making the change. E.g.:
#	#	rcctl reload httpd
#fi
#
#if [ -n "$lastPrefix" ]; then
#	#	We need to figure out what he old IPv6 address was. Left as an exercise for the
#	#	reader. It probably helps that the interface identifier should not change for
#	#	various reasons.
#	local oldAddr=â€¦

#	#	Next do something to deactivate the old rules/settings/etc.
#fi


#
#	EOF.
